>A machine learning to statistics translator I try to maintain. Most concepts are not really identical, so “translations” should be considered approximate. Based on the same idea in “All Of Statistics” by Larry Wasserman [p.15]. Many thanks to Ohad Shamir, and Saharon Rosset for helping populate the table. Despite my best efforts, it proably still contains errors. Drop me a note if you find any.
